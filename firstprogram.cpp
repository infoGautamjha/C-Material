//Introduction to C++ Programming Language
// Last Updated : 27-04-2025
// C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an enhancement of the C language to add object-oriented paradigm. It is a high-level programming language that was first released in 1985 and since then has become the foundation of many modern technologies like game engines, web browsers, operating systems, financial systems, etc.

// Features of C++
// The main features C++ programming language are as follows:

// Simple: It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, and has a rich library support and a variety of datatypes.

// Machine Independent: C++ code can be run on any machine as long as a suitable compiler is provided.

// Low-level Access: C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which makes it a suitable choice for system programming and writing efficient code.

// Fast Execution Speed: C++ is one of the fastest high-level languages. There is no additional processing overhead in C++, it is blazing fast.

// Object-Oriented: One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. large-scale applications can be built.

// Applications of C++
// C++ is used in a wide range of applications from game engines and application software to operating systems and embedded systems.

// Why Learn C++?
// C++ is often taught as a foundational language to aspiring programmers, but it is much more than that:

// C++ remains one of the most used and popular programming languages used in making operating systems, embedded systems, graphical user interfaces and nowadays in high frequency trading (HFT) software.
// It supports both low-level and high-level features such as manual memory management and OOPs programming respectively.
// Syntax similarity with C, Java, and C# makes it easier to switch languages.
// C++ provides one of the fastest execution speeds among high level languages, which can be a deciding factor in Competitive Programming or high-performance applications.

// First C++ Program
// The below program is one of the simplest C++ programs that shows the basic structure of its programs:


// History of C++
// C++ was initially developed by Bjarne Stroutrup as an extension of C language to include OOPs concepts. It was first introduces as “C with Classes” in 1979 at Bell Labs. It was named C++ in 1982. The language later standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

// The first official standard C++98 released in 1998.

// This was followed by C++03 in 2003 which was a minor update that addressed defects and clarified ambiguities in the C++98 standard.

// The major update came with C++ 11 in 2011 which introduced a lot of features like lambda expressions, smart pointers, etc. After this, an update starts being released once in 3 years.

// C++14 (2014) and C++17 (2017), brought incremental improvements, refining C++11 features and adding new utilities like filesystem support.

// The latest major standards C++20 (2020) and C++23 (2024) continue to modernize the language with concepts, modules, and enhanced concurrency.

// C++ vs Other Programming Languages
// Let’s see where C++ stands as compared to other programming language:

// Feature	C++	C	Java	Python	JavaScript
// Type	Compiled	Compiled	Compiled and Interpreted	Interpreted	Interpreted
// Paradigm	Multi-paradigm (procedural, object-oriented, generic)	Procedural, structured	Object-oriented, structured	Multi-paradigm (object-oriented, procedural, functional)	Multi-paradigm (event-driven, functional)
// Memory Management	Manual	Manual	Automatic	Automatic	Automatic (with garbage collection)
// Syntax	Complex	Complex	Complex	Simple	Simple (but can be more complex with frameworks)
// Use Cases	System programming, game development, high-performance applications	System programming, embedded systems, game development	Large-scale applications, enterprise software	Web development, data analysis, machine learning	Web development, server-side scripting, mobile apps
// Notable Frameworks/Libraries	Standard Library, Boost	Standard Library	Spring, Hibernate	Django, Flask	Node.js, React, Angular, Vue, Express
// Community Support	Strong	Strong	Strong	Strong	Strong
// Job Market	Abundant	Abundant	Abundant	Abundant	Abundant
